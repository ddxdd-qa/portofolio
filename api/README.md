# QA Lab API

These Vercel serverless functions power the interactive Playwright QA Lab on the portfolio.

## Deployment

Deploy the repository as a Vercel project. The `api/` directory is detected automatically.

Required environment variable:

- `GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN` — a GitHub fine-grained token with Actions read/write access to `ddxdd-qa/portofolio`.

The token stays server-side and is never exposed to the portfolio frontend.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` — confirms that the API is reachable and whether the GitHub token is configured.
- `POST /api/run-tests` — dispatches `.github/workflows/qa-lab.yml` on `main`.
- `GET /api/test-status` — returns the latest manually dispatched workflow and its jobs/steps.
- `GET /api/test-status?run_id=<id>` — returns a specific workflow run.

The current implementation streams execution state by polling GitHub Actions every 2.5 seconds from the portfolio UI. A true live browser viewport is a separate streaming layer; GitHub Actions itself does not expose the hosted browser as a live video stream.
